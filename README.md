# Unsharp-Masking-in-image-processing
In this project, with the help of various average filters, we perform un-sharp masking operations
In this project, with the help of using a mean 3 * 3 smoothing filter, we apply a non-sharp box filter to the child image.
Then we implement non-sharp masking with the Weighted Average type 3 * 3 smoothing filter.
Repeat this operation with larger filters of 7 * 7, 5 * 5, and 9 * 9
Then, in non-sharp masking, we use the middle filter as a smoothing filter
Apply image sharpening in both non-horizontal and adaptive forms on face1 and face2 images
